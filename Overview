# Football-Match-Prediction
This project finds out how different statistics in football can determine the outcome of a game. The project focuses on the English Premier League and uses past data, feature selection and various machine learning algorithms to come up with a prediction model.
The aim of this project is to understand which attributes of a team contribute to their overall
success, and the importance of each attribute in doing so as well. Also, using a classification model,
we have tried to predict the outcome of each game, given certain team attributes as input. The
outcomes are multi-class and have been labeled as HOME (Home Team Wins), AWAY (Away Team
Wins) and DRAW. We collected the data for our model through multiple disparate data sources,
going through data from multiple English Premier League seasons along with looking at individual
team statistics published by FIFA and merging them together in order to create our primary dataset.
The model started off with data visualization, where we looked at each predictor and their skewness
in order to determine whether the distribution in data would be detrimental to the accuracy of our
model. We looked at collinearity and correlations between various predictors and integrated those
into our model, which did not result in an overfitted model nor with a one with a very low accuracy.
